Sorry but the no child left behind program is bull in my mind , but if people are unintelligent it means they wo n't think for themselves and if they do n't think for themselves they are easier to control. thats pretty much laying down the ground work for for future generations of kids to be obese , corperate sell outs for the government to use .
