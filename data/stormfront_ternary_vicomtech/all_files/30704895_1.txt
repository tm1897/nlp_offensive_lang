if i end up with kids i would prefer to home school them. i worry about it though as i am not very intelligent , nor do i have experience with kids or educating them. i guess i couldnt do much worse than the public schools though. i do have a kind of plan as far as social skills. i would put my kids in sports and classes like gymnastics and karate .
