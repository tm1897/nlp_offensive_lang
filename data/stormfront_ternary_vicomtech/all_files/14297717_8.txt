That 's the only beach i 've ever been to and then again i 've only been 4 or so times , the first time I went I saw 3 skins , two being guys and one had a panzerfaust shirt on and the other had a big swazi on his lower back and it did n't seem like he was getting * * * * for it in public , then I saw a few other 's on later trip 's , you 're not alone comrade .
