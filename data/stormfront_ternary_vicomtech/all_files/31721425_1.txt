well there is a little history for this post so listen up if you dont mind. there was a group in this city called the 311 boys supposedly they were a racist bunch of kids but i never thought they were but through the newspaper and manipulation of sotries they were labled as racist. well my views arnt that well known at school but some do know and ive been labled a `` 311 '' boy. a group of about 10 or so blacks approached me before school. now im not some little guy im a decent build and really have no fear of anyone or anything at this point in my life. well anyway they came up to me and started asking me if i was 311 if i was a racist and all this crap. i denied mostly for my own safety at the time. well i talked to some people who asked me who i thoguht were friends but it turns out they werent. they went right around and told them some of my views and now they came up to me at lunch today and pushed me around a little i stood up to them and got up in their faces but finally a hall monitor came and broke it up. im just wondering whats going to happen in the next few days since im the only WP kid in my school and am standing alone on this issue. just decided to post this bit of information for you wall to read keep safe and keep smart .
