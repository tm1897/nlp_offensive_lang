I am new on here and so far i like most of what i have seen.I am looking for some suggestions on reading material i should read to educate myself about my heritage and how to protect it.I know there are some intelligent people on here who can point me in the right direction or even share some of their knowledge with me so i can be more educated and prepared to be able to help not only myself but my race .
