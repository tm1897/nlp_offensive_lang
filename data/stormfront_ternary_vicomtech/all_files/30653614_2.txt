If a person 's sexuality is an issue for them only then it should be an issue for us , normal people of either orientation do n't have their sex life at the centre of their attention all the time , a heterosexual deviant is just as much as a problem as a homosexual deviant and there are more straight perverts and psychos around trying to `` infiltrate '' groups than there are homosexuals .
