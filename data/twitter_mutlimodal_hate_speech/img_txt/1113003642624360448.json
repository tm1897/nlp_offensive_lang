{"img_text": "fb/MYRELIGIONISRAP Demetrius Meech Shipp 43 mins We know why and who please stop with the sensationalism No conspiracy No hit just a a low life rat who left and came back to do the devil's work Please try to control your wild internet brain .Some of us know him personally and it's annoying as hell just like someone telling me about Pac who wasn't there .You a fan . When u succeed in the BLK community and try to stay in that community and have to rub shoulders with low life scum... A known rat did this .it wasn't a hit.no one leaves and comes back to do a premeditated hit It was no Dr Sebi conspiracythe guy is a known rat and was asked to leave and returned to do his dirty work...Whenever a black man has had a certain amount of success he is more of a target. Tupac died , ,he got killed behind a Compton gang bang beef not some romantic idea he held some power that the world feared .RIP Nip NHC Tupac & Nip have this in common that u can't be a star and deal with or be around low level shit.. What they did or didn't do is seen as more disrespectful to someone in the streets. these are the facts now stay off my post and don't ask me about no fictional Dr Sebi theory or nothing's else black ppl do not love or value black lives... FYI \"We Made America Great \" and still continue to do so "}
