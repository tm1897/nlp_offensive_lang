{"img_text": "A Man's A Man For A' That 1795 Type: Song Tune: For a' that. Is there for honest Poverty That hings his head, an a that; The coward slave-we pass him by, We dare be poor for a' that! For a that, an' a that. Our toils obscure an' a that, The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The Man's the gowd for a that. What though on hamely fare we dine, Wear hoddin grey, an' a that; Gic fools their silks, and knaves their wine A Man's a Man for a' that For a that, and a' that, Their tinsel show, an' a' that; The honest man, tho' s'er sac poor Is king o' men for a' that. Ye see yon birkie, ca'd a lord. Wha struts, an stares, an' a that Tho' hundreds worship at his word, He's but a soof for a' that: For a' that, an' a' that, His ribband, star, an' a' that The man o' independent mind He looks an' laughs at a' that. A prince can mak a belted knight, A marquis, duke, an' a' that But an honest man's abon his might, Gude faith, he maunna fa that! For a' that, an' a' that, Their dignities an' a that; The pith o' sense, an' pride e worth, Are higher rank than a' that. Then let us pray that come it may (As come it will for a' that) That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth, Shall bear the gree, an' a that. For a that, an' a' that, It's coming yet for a that, That Man to Man, the world o'er Shall brothers be for a that. "}
