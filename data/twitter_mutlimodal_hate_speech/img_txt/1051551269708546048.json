{"img_text": "After seeing Winovich get tackled on the 2nd to last play with a ref staring right at it I realized that the standard for holding against a Michigan defender must be significantly higher than other teams. There's also data to prove it. In the past 4 seasons of 81G games (including the 2 so far this season) Michigan's defense has only drawn 11 holding calls. That's 11 holding calls in 28 games. Far and away the lowest of other teams. Edit: Full stats that I have for the past 4 seasons... Team Holding Calls Accepted (B1G Play) Indiana 23 Wisconsin 21 20 20 20 Michigan State osU Penn State 19 18 Edit 2: Since these numbers are also important (They do not include this season currently) Team Accepted Holds Per 100 Plays Defended Total holds Per 100 Plays Defended 1.38 1.21 1.17 1.14 1.12 1.12 1.10 Wisconsin 1.14 1.23 1.32 Michigan State osu 1.09 1.14 1.17 94 Penn State 93 .87 97 76 81 "}
