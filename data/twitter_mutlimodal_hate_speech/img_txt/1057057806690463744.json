To ensure that your account isn't classed as inactive. Hold down on this photo and press the blue arrow and send it to at least 50 people on your snapchat list This is extremely important that you do this because otherwise we have no other obligation but to remove your account from the app. Happy Snapping! 3:53 AM-Oct 10, 2018 75 Retweets 461 Likes I'm safe I already done it I've checked the official twitter and it's real, I've already done it so I'm fine.
