{"img_text": "1:16\u30a4 ill LTE Photo seiten Liked by jennasita_carnitas and 802 others seiten Thursday night I was struck by a car that was going about 50mph and didn't stop. I have a few fractured ribs, major road rash, a couple stitches to my dome, bruising of the kidneys and some other shit. Thankful to say that I'm alive and had some amazing friends and family who are taking care of me. Ps. Phone was stolen so just hmu on here if you need me. "}
