{"img_text": "Tweet Austin Aries @AustinAries #WorldVeganDay You're taught that murder is wrong, but only if a human is murdered. You're taught that serial killers are bad, but hunting is a sport. You're taught that Auschwitz was evil, but slaughterhouses and fur farms are humane. You're taught that jail is for punishment, but zoos are a fun place for animals.
