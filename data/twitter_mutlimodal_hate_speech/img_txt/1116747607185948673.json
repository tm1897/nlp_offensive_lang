{"img_text": "THE PATTERN Your Timing Right now, if you're in a relationship and unable to connect deeply, this situation will feel accentuated and possibly become intolerable, like you can't live with it anymore. Someone new might enter your life who you'd normally be closed off to. They might appear to have the passionate, redemptive qualities that you're looking for. If you're single, you might meet someone who seems to be the model for what you desire. In either case, it's important to know that you're not seeing circumstances clearly right now; what's transpiring isn't what it seems. "}
