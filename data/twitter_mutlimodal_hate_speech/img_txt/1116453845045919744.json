{"img_text": "12:36 PM a taqiyya meme 0 AT&T I aqiyya ISLAMIC DECEPTION Muslims are taught to deceive the kuffar (non-Muslim) about their true be- liefs in order to defend the cause of Islam and Jihad. This deception is called taqiyya. Muslims will attempt to disassociate Islam from terrorist acts in order to win sympathy and public opinion, especially in countries where they are outnumbered by non-Muslims. They will say that such an act does not represent the \"true Islam, when in fact it does. Over 60% of the Quran contains verses about killing the kuffar, or forcing them to live under servitude as dhimmi and pay a heavy tax known as Jizya. Dhimmi's must defer to Muslims in all manners whatsoever Islamic Sharia law requires all Muslims to pay a charity tithe called Zakat A portion of Zakat is required to be used to fund Jihadists, such as A Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Taliban. If they truly opposed terrorism they would not pay the Zakat. Since 911, Muslims have committed over 23.000 acts of terror. 90% of all terrorist acts are committed by Muslims "}
