{"img_text": "modsin everyone wha cr inv to discord, we have mods in everyone who creates/runs a discord to make sure you're not leaking things Carlton chase you have your own discord.. and it has to be you or no chase For how you're being about it, yes. It's not being Lewis Carlton well to be honest you've always been quite a prick to me for no apparent reason. i wasnt going to suggest lewis but eazy, and he seems to agree with it so imma inv him now. and the group isnt a cook group or anything just a few people i like, so again idk why youre being a prick. chase I honestly don't even know who you are and I've seen your name once Imao. Doesn't matter if it's a cook group or not, it's something we require when someone makes their own discord and advertises it Carlton yeah well i've got eazy in now and idc if you know who i am but tthe few interactions we've had you've just been a total prick so "}
