{"img_text": "W Fox 24 mins ago That's the kind of ungreatful person you find in any game. After help Gemmalady in Dragon's Dogma with a bunch lM 3 items, teach her how properly use her Magic Archer and help her to build the best strider strider for her pawn. All i get back were bad rates from her, self promoting her friends expecting i hire their pawns too and this trully immature comments on Pawn Hub Community cuz she isn't mature enough to resolve her own problems without involve more people. She's toxic and her elitism is disgusting. Back W Fox "}
