{"img_text": "Its called Jews vs the Nazis. Its 3-on-3, 30 cups per team. The Nazis shape ther 30 cups into a swastika, and the Jews set up their 30 cups as the star of David. The cups are re-racked to a smaller swastika and a smaller star when 18 cups remain on either team. The Nazis start the game off with bitzkreig,' and each player on the Nazis shoots until they miss, but this is only allowed for the first voley. The Jews have the Anne Frank Cup,' and this ability allows them to pick any one of their cups and hide it anywhere in the room, but it has to be shootable, obviously. The Jews can only do that once per game and can be used only during their turn. To equalize this slight advantage, the Nazis also have another abaty called Auschwitz' (or Concentration Camp if you don't know what that means). With this ability the Nazis can pick any player on the Jews team and they have to sit out of the game until the other two players on the Jews team each make a cup. After that happens the 3rd person on the Jews teanm can play again. Also, throughout the game you are supposed to talk alot of shit and say as many racist things as possible to make it more enjoyable. My Jewish friends actually love this game haha. "}
