{"img_text": "Verizon LTE 09:15 Hello Dr. Mopper, I left my clicker at home today and am unable to officially record my attendance. Typically I would not worry about this, howeverI missed 6 classes in the past 3 weeks due to hospitalization and my current attendance grade is suffering. I hope this is enough to prove today's attendance. Thank you "}
