{"img_text": "ok im gonna tell u anyways so you know how vangoh or however tfu spell it he ate yellow paint because yellow is a bright colour and he thought eating it would make him happy, and everyone thought he was crazy for eating something so poisonous and toxic. but if you look at it through less judgemental eyes you see that hes just like everyone else, who really drinks alcohol anymore for the taste everyone wants to get drunk and to forget, no one smokes weed because they like the taste they smoke it because it makes them happier and why do you think that girl stays with her cheating boyfriend? because when hes not cheating on her he makes her happy even though its toxic and poisonous. The reality of it is that we're all just desperately searching for a way to be happy even if it isnt good for us like everything bad we do is our yellow paint "}
