{"img_text": "I'm so tired of telling this old guy that no -I don't want a man. And that no I'm not gonna marry a man. I finally told him today that the only way I'm getting married again is if she's got a real pretty smile and he just looked at me. Then he said \"there's something wrong with you, that ain't right\" and walked out muttering under his breath. So yeah he can go fuck himself. "}
