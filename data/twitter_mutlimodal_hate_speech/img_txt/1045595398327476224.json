Honestly keep your politics out of video games Not Recommended 5.5 hrs on record Posted: September 28 Although the game itself is pretty good, it contains blatant leftist propaganda that makes US look like a country full of white-skinned rednecks who are eager to kill some mexican kids. It's unbelievable how game industry has changed since LS1.

I like that the first Life is Strange remained almost entirely unbiased and was not trying to push any sort of agenda. This game on the otherhand is constantly trying to push some sort of agenda or SJW opinion. I just outright decided after the first hour to just go ahead and refund my money and watch the rest on Youtube. I am all for conflicting opinions, but not when they are being forced down my throat "}
