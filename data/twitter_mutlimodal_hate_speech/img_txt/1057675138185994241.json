{"img_text": "Dunkan Pinderhuse 18 hrs I was released from jail this year after spending 11 years for rape. The woman I raped kept the pregnancy and had a child. Now that I'm out of prison and a completely changed man, would I be wrong for trying to have a relationship with my child and the mum? After all, I am the child's biological father so I do have a right to be in his life. Please help me. "}
