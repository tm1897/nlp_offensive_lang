{"img_text": "Info Hello World private Game game; private boolean talkShit(Player player) if (player.isMad0-# true) { throw new NullPointerException(\"Variable life was l not declared\") return game If you're reading this. I probably just got done shitting on you and now you're checking my Steam profile so you can talk shit in the in-game chat because you're hella mad and feeling some type of way. Steam account with one game (B03) equals cheater. Amirite? I'm totally not a university student majoring in CS (Computer Science) and I cough cough Minecraft & GTA V, and I totally don't program when I'm not wasting my life on COD which is why I don't have a lot of games because I'm not one who spend hours playing games but you wouldn't know that because you're a special kind of stupid stoopid. If talking shit in a game is how you let your anger out. Do as you please. We all have different ways of taking our anger out. I'm not judging you but understand you're typing to a guy you wouldn't say a damn thing to IRL so have fun keyboard warrior and let that sink in. What's real don't have to be explained I totally don't play other games not on Stearm Best regards, "}
