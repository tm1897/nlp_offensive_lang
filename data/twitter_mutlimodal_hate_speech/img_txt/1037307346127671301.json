{"img_text": "Good morning!Q Several of us were wondering if there can be more options for those of us who are dairy free. We understand that the coffee machines in the MKs are just for cows milk but sticking our plant based milk in the microwave causes some milks to get a film, others have a weird texture. It never comes out well. Is there any way that a machine could be dedicated just to non dairy milk? Perhaps a barista machine in the cafeteria that everyone can use to foam S their milk? Some of the coffee machines have the option to steam milk manually Maybe one machine could be dedicated for steaming milk by hand like they do at Grand Canal? Today I was dying for a cappuccino and watched my coworkers enjoy theirs There are many of us who do not consume dairy milk for medical, ethical or health reasons. We should be able to have the option for a decent coffee too. THANKS AND PLEASE TTI:2.8s DD:3.8s 0 5 e 6 7 89 "}
