{"img_text": "410s .11 55% 16:39 PM Harvey Wilson 12 hrs . News Alert!!!! I'm here in NC doing security for the Hurricane, a big farm flooded and 5500 hogs were killed. If you eat pork, I wouldn't buy pork from any store for a while. They are not gonna take that kind of loss. I can't tell you what the farmer told me. But a word to the wise should be sufficient "}
