{"img_text": "For the many not the few Ronnie Campbell MP Radway Cottapes South Newsham BLYTH Dear Martin Young The Tory government are presiding over a crisis in the UK. In foodbank Britain austerity has pushed public services ike the NHS and the polce to the brink and communities onto their knees. And as this happens the Tories have pirioritised tax cuts for the rich. Labour has a very different plan and very different priorities for our country A plan that will invest in our people and our communities. That is why we are calling for the government to move aside and call a general election so Labour can get on with rebuilding our country When this election comes, every vote will be vital. We all live busy lives and going to the polling station can be difficult. I am writing to suggest you sign up for a postal vote. With a postal vote, you can fill in your ballot and wil have plenty of time to send it back. Its free and easy to use. No more trudging to the polling station in the wind and rain Fill in the application form, pop it in an addressed envelope, put on a stamp and send it back to the Council. It is that simple Even if a General Election does not happen soon, we will elect a Mayor for the North of the Tyne on the 2d May this year. This person will have significant powers over transport, economic development, housing and education in an area covering Northumberland, Newcastle and North Tyneside. It is vital that this person is a Labour representative who will fight for local services and protect our communities Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and I hope you will consider applying for a postal vote soon. All the best onnie Campbell MP ember of Parliament for Blyth Valley Don't forget to put a stamp on the return envelope Labour Thursday 2nd May 2019 Please recycle "}
