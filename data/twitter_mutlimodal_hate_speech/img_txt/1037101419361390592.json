{"img_text": "DEAR SINGERS AND ACTORS: WE SPEND OUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO HEAR YOUR MUSIC. AND TO WATCH YOU PRETEND TO BE CHARACTERS MOVIES AND 0H TV YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO ENTERTAIN US. TO TAKE US AWAY FROM REALITY YOUR PERSONAL OPINION MEANS NOTHING TO US. YOU ARE SIGNIFICANT AND INFLUENTIAL ONLY IN YOUR OWN MIND, AND WITHIN THE MINDS OF YOUR ELITIST PEERS. YOU ARE A MARIONETTE TO US. NOTHING MORE. SING. ACT. SHUT UP. "}
