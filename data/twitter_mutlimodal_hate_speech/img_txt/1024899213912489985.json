{"img_text": "i had a friend once who i thought of him as a \"brother\" and we gotten so close in such short period of time. i mean, people gave me shit when they hear us being friends cus he's known as an asshole who stirs shit up even in high school behind my back after basically he just never my best friend left, apparently he's been telling her and my boyfriend (before we got together) how he wanted to fuck me up and down. and imagined my boobs bouncing and all that grew up I STILL remained friends with him regardless how disgusted and disrespectful i felt, but then again with his high school shit, he stirred things up and fucked a lot of things for me and my boyfriend, we have never been so HAPPY and relieved to let go a TOXIC friendship.
