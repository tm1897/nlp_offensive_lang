{"img_text": "The scientific legacy of Rube's work lives on in the machine contests that bear his name. The grandfathe of STEM education, Rube blended Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math long before the acronym existed. STEM starts with the Rube Goldberg Machine Contests, which every year ask students of all ages to build overly complicated and comically contrived inventions that complete a simple task. 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of the RGMCs, which now include participants from more than a dozen countries in both online and live events.
