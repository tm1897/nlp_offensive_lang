{"img_text": "\"The bottoms\" is what hill folks used to call the delta. When Grandma and Grandpa went t the bottoms\" to pick cotton, they went down around Jonesboro and West Memphis, and in the 1920's and 1930's they would have worked those fields right beside black people. They were not prejudiced because they did not see themselves as superior, but rather as equals. Excerpt from \"Nigger?\" an essay by Karlyle Tomms Pheto\u00b7by Knrtyle Tonins "}
