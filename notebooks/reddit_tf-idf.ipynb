It may seem unfair to some (for some retarded reason), but I'd personally love for the presumption of innocence to still be a thing the day I'm accused of doing something I didn't do. I'm not saying he did or didn't do it, I'm saying that we presume people innocent for a god damn fucking reason.  Now the fact that he lied multiple times in front of the Senate and read a speech that could seriously have been written by a 5th grader was pretty fucking repulsive and for that reason alone the GOP should have ditched him.

       " 'Get a load of this fucking retard... Let me attempt to explain (probably unsuccessfully) to your shit for brains what I mean.  1) I\\'m sick and tired of idiots disrespecting the source material in the name of \"muh duh-ver-see-tee\" and virtue signaling. Particularly Americunts such as Hollywood. If you want to make your \"diverse utopia\", do it on your own, make up your own story, don\\'t bastardize existing source material. And it\\'s always - *always* - race swap from white to whatever other color and from male to female. Even if it doesn\\'t make *any* sense whatsoever and even if actually completely breaks the established lore which was the case with Idris Elba in The Dark Tower where racism was actually a big plot in the source material and in fact it was what you liberal morons would call \"reverse racism\" of a black person hating a white person for being white.  Another insane example is that batshit absurd bullshit remake they are trying to make of the Lord of the Flies with *all female cast*. In what universe does it make sense (well in your demented NPC brain it probably does) to convert the all male cast to all female cast and not destroy the core and the fundamental idea of the source material?   Well, \"diversifying\" the Witcher cast makes just about the same amount of sense (for people too stupid to breathe like you this means \"none\").  2) The Witcher is essentially the first or at least the most famous story that comes from Eastern Europe and popularizes our Slavic mythology and culture. I am an Eastern European Slav myself. And yes, it may come as a complete surprise to your \"progressive\" shit for brains, but we do have our own culture for about ~1500 years, give or take a few hundred. And let me tell you what hasn\\'t changed for these 15+ centuries. We don\\'t have \"diverse\" people. In fact we happen to be some of the whitest motherfuckers in existence, proly only the Scandinavians are whiter. I\\'m so very sorry it \"hurts\" your Western politically correct \"duh-ver-see-tee\" and \"inclusivity\" bullshit but this is **OUR** culture and if you don\\'t like it you can go fuck yourself, preferably with a rusty fork shoved deep inside your anus. I guess \"all cutlures are equal and beautiful\" except yours, yours is too white, we need to \"diversify\" it a little so we can pat ourselves on the back how \"progressive\" we are so that the western feminists social justice retards don\\'t REEEEEEEEE.  So what, we are not allowed to have our own culture? It\\'s not \"diverse\" and \"inclusive\" enough for you? Well, I\\'m sorry, but being the \"original slaves\" we didn\\'t have much time to \"diversify\" it so that early 21st century millennial NPCs won\\'t be triggered by our evil demonic \"whiteness\". I\\'m absolutely sure that you wouldn\\'t mind if we make a reboot of the African Shaka Zulu series and cast Channing Tatum in the role of King Shaka? I\\'m also absolutely certain that you loved Gods of Egypt and its \"authentic\" cast.  So just like you liberal lunatics love to spew this \"whitewashing\" crap, can I also ask to stop \"darkwashing\" **MY** culture? It\\'s not like Slavic culture is that popular and mainstream in the west. We have this one thing and you just have to fuck it all up because of your \"duh-ver-see-tee\" and \"progressive-ness\".  3) Triss canon hair color is not red, it\\'s chestnut, dumbass. And she is \"best girl\" (you NPCs really can\\'t meme) because I love her character from the books. She is my favorite character in the entire series.

To the point that California passed a law saying that every board of a publicly traded company in California has to have a woman on it. That\\'s entirely inconsistent with Marxists that would not want those boards to exist.  Yes, they pivoted to grievance studies as the next best avenue for attacking Western Civilization aka capitalism. They are useful idiots who would be openly Marxist if it were a viable declaration - and indeed some of them declare it anyways. If the boards are going to exist, they want women on them. And those women should, of course, be feminists. Because feminists will, of course, *operate the boards in a manner antithetical to the boards*. That\\'s the goal.

       " \"Ok, this can be a long one. People may think that i'm a hypocrite in saying that we should oppose feminism because they have a lot of sexist and misandrist feminists in their movement, while still I still support the MRM.  First of all I don't hate feminists in the sense that I want them to be killed, hurt, raped, have their rights stripped from them or any such thing. I don't want any harm for them, or to have something bad happen to them as a form of vengeance.  But I still hate feminists nonetheless. Why? Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them.   We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.  The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.  Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.  They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially.   And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.  While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized misogyny.  They served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.  The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.  But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.  Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men.   Those good feminists didn’t want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.  So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.\",\n",

You mean the self-proclaimed male feminist, who was accused falsely, and legitimately felt bad about the situation and tried his best to make things right despite the fact that again, he did nothing wrong. Who by the way, he was never forced to take a breather, he never took a breather, and the idea of him not continuing to do his thing was never brought into question by anyone... This woman is so fucked in the head. This is without question someone who is a sociopath.   Ansari’s charges  He was charged with nothing, you deranged demonizing psycho cuuuuunt.   the reality is that many women are still taught  Its always interesting reading a feminist start the sentence with this, and always end it with lies. Women are taught they are always the victim, they should always be afraid, men are stupid and below them, and should worship them. I could go on. They are never taught to be the caretakers of the male ego, no evidence to support that.   We learn at an early age to value ourselves based on our ability to be agreeable, to please others, to silence our anger.   This one makes me laugh, this applies to all human beings, and its called not being a shit head. Is that really difficult to do?   To deny that this is still reinforced to young women daily is a privilege of ignorance and convenience.   Privilege of ignorance and convenience is not ever seeing men as victims.

Unlike most (not all) women, who apologize so often that we have professional support groups to stop us, their response is not to feel sorry for what their accusers might have been feeling; there’s not an ounce of real self-reflection to be found. Instead, they are furious at being policed. For the first time, we are not care-taking their egos. And I have never seen them so mad.  This is perfect. This is so fucking perfect.

He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.
